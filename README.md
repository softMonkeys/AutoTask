This app enables the automation of anything on your phone, example: when you connect to your house WiFi, run a sync app or script. It should be able to launch any app on the phone, with URI support to pass through arguments. The rules for launch apps/scripts should include basic Boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT/XOR/NOR) with unlimited entries. These rules should also be exportable and importable, and preferably be editable by any text editor. The product should be open source, as other versions lock out features and eventually die. This app is useful in everyday life as you can program it to atomize tasks/actions that you would do repeatedly.

– User should be able to create condition as WiFi connection, sync , timer or low battery-level. – User should be able to create logic-condition to be logic term (AND/OR/NOT/XOR/NOR) of some condition. – User should be able to create operation as launching any app/script or URI. – User should be able to create a relation between specified logic-condition to specified operation. – User should be able to deactivated a relation. – User can export rules (set of relations, logic-conditions and operations) to a text file. – User can import text file that contains rules into app.

***Non Functional requirement of the project:

– System should be able to detect if condition is satisfied. – System should be able to detect if logic-condition is satisfied. – System should activated a relation once created. – System should be able to execute some operation when logic-condition related is satisfied. – Number of condition for one logic-condition is unlimited. – App is uploaded to share-platform
